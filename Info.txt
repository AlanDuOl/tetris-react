BUGs:
    - Wall does not accept tiles outside of its height:
        - Hard to know game over because tiles don't stay outside the wall

TODO:
    - Try to use the block rotation loop logic to other collision detection:
        - checkMoveLeft
        - checkMoveRight
        - bottomCollision
    - Update level
    - Allow keyboard keys
    - Use web workers
    - Replace console.log for console.error on try catchs
    - Refactor game Over logic in wallSetTiles
