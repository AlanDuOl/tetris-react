Component types:

Reactive component
Block:
    actions:
        - restart (ok)
        - move (down) (ok)
        - check for collision:
            - on side move:
                - use left + block width < viewportWidth
            - on rotation:
                - use left + block width > viewportWidth
                - rotation collision does not happen on left side
            - on move down:
                - make bottom go up with another element?
        - speed up (ok)
        - stop (ok)
        - rotate (ok)
        - move left/right (ok)
